The system settings page is only visible to application administrators:

Here you can get the `appId` and `appSecret` information required by `xtransit`to access this application.

The administrator can also rename the application and delete the application here. It should be noted that all instances will be disconnected after deleting the application, and the monitoring data, performance analysis files, etc. will be lost. You need to be careful.
